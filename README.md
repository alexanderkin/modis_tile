# modis_tile
tiles for modis sinusoidal projections, but provided on geographic coords

Skelton of [MODIS Sinusoidal Tile Grid](https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html), created in geographic coordinate (lat/lon).  It is trivially simple to create such grid in Sinusoidal projection, but it was hard for me to take care of region neear the international date line.  

Code (python) is posted soon.
